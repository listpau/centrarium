# [Pendulum Demo](https://listpau.github.io/pendulum/pendularm1.html)

A one degree-of-freedom frictionless pendulum with massless link and idealized servo controller. Numerical integrator methods include Euler, Verlet, Velocity Verlet, and Runge-Kutta. Motion control is achieved using PID to reach an arbitrary setpoint.
