#### This site contains a sample of some projects I've done in the past, and a little bit about me!

This was made using Centrarium, a custom theme for Jekyll made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his blog. Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/). And you can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
